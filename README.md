- defaultCities.json: Is the JSON file that will provide the already existing countries and cities when you use the application. They are configured in city, country and Timezone. The IANA-timezone format is going to be converted into time with Intl.DateTimeFormat. This will display the time and not the name of the timezone on page.
- worldsTimezone.json: is the JSOn file that provides the worlds all different timezones when wanting to add new City or country to the application as a user. The list is devided into timezones continentials. Instead of doing a dropdown menu of all the countries and its cities, I'll put it in timezone categories.
- Mark as favorite and adding new city/country: Doing this as a user will save the data to localstorage.
